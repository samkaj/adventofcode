letters with _ as prefix are positions for 7segs which are not broken.

acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab

cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf (none are 8, 7, 4 or 1)

8 = acedgfb
7 = dab
4 = eafb
1 = ab

_a = 7 - 1 = dab - ab = d

cefabd abcdef (0 9)

cdfgeb bcdefg (6)

cagedb abcdeg (0 9)

d, a, b = (0 9) -> the letter which doesnt include all three is 6! -> 6 = cdfgeb
     ddddd
    .    a/b
    .    a/b
     .....
    .    a/b
    .    a/b
     .....

we can determine _c by subtracting 6 from 8. we now know _f as well.
8-6     = abcdefg -  b(c)defg = a (6) -> _c=a

every 6 lenghter has _f=b, _b=?, _a=d, _g=?

     ddddd
    .     a
    .     a
     .....
    .     b
    .     b
     .....

9 shares every letter but one with 8. subtracting 8 with 9 leavers _e!
let's determine 9.

there are 3 digits with 6 letters: 0, 6 and 9.
6 is known.
8 - 6 leaves 1, which is the letter that is in 9 and 0.

abcdef (0/9) - 8 => g

bcdefg (6) - 8 => a

abcdeg (0/9) - 8 => f

from this, we get a clue.

     ddddd
    .     a
    .     a
     .f/g.
   f/g    b
   f/g    b
     .....

to find which one is _g, we can try to find 3!
it has 5 digits, and subtracting dab(f/g) we should get no remainder.
dabf:
    cdfbe -> ce
    gcdfa -> gc
    fbcad -> c (this is 3! -> _g = c) -> and 3 does not contain g, -> _e = g

     ddddd
    .     a
    .     a
     .f/g.
   f/g    b
   f/g    b
     ccccc

with our _e conclusion, we find that _d = f!

now we only have one remaining, which is e, which goes in _b = e!

     ddddd
    e     a
    e     a
     fffff
    g     b
    g     b
     ccccc
